# waterline-orientdb specific Integration Tests

`waterline-adapter-tests` provide a good layer of basic coverage for adapters.  Since usage is standarized, tests are highly reusable.

That said, if there are adapter-specific integration tests (e.g. requiring a database connection) that you feel should be added, the sub-folder tests is the place to do it.
